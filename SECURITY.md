# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Just because MathOnWeb does not save any data about you and your user behaviour,
there are no real security issues. Nevertheless, there may some risks that can have an
effect. There are only security updates for the latest version of MathOnWeb. So if you are
using the public instance your security level is always up to date.
If you hosted the application yourself, you can validate if your current version is still secure.

| Version | Secure             |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.6.0   | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.5.3   | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.4.0   | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.3.5   | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.3.0   | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.2.0   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.1.2 | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you found a security risk, just create a new issue and explain how you found the risk
and how I can recreate it. After that it will be fixed as soon as possible in the next update.
You should also test this risk in different versions of the application, so I am able to specify which
versions of the software are safe.
